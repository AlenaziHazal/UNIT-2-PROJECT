<p> The growth of the real governorate and the city began in the year 1369-1370 AH, 1949-1950, with the institutionalization of the Tapline Line, which connected the oil regions in the east of the Arabian Kingdom with the port of Al-Zahrani, south of the Lebanese city of Sidon, passing through the countries of Jordan, and wherever Saudi Arabia decided to establish the lineâ€™s paths to strengthen pumping in this area, which was named Yamr. The principles of boycotting pipelines and winning the opportunity to work in this station attract people little by little to it until these population centers unite into one of the major cities along this line.</p>
