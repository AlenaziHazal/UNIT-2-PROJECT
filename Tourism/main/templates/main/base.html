However, despite this, the status of tourism in the Arab world, and in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in particular, is still very limited, as its size is not 3% of the gross domestic product. Saudi Arabia invested about 25 billion riyals in this field during the period between 1995 and 2002.</p>

        <p> Tourism in Saudi Arabia
          Saudi Arabia is a land of abundant natural and historical spectacles. It has been a travel destination for Muslim pilgrims for centuries from all over the world. In Saudi Arabia, tourism was associated only with religious travelling until a few years ago. However, the trend has changed in recent years, and now leisure tourism has also become an important area of development for the Saudi government (About Saudi Arabia, 2015).
          
          With the formation of the Supreme Commission for Tourism in April 2000, now known as the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquity (SCTA), greater emphasis is being laid on the development of tourism, preservation of the historical sites, and conservation of the traditional crafts in the country. Saudi Arabia has remained the centre of most religious pilgrimages for centuries. But now it has started focusing on the leisure tourism sector too. Domestic tourism has also been growing in the region in recent years (Vincent, 2008)</p>
